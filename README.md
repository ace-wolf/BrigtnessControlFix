# Brigtness Control Fix for A707

Since my Schenker Notbook XMG A707 dosn't get an update for the hotkey driver and the brightness hotkeys are broken for a few months now I programmed a quick fix.

Not tested on any other model. Have fun.

YOU CAN MODIFY THIS SOFTWARE FOR YOURSELF BUT DO NOT REDIRTIBUTE ANY VERSION WITHOUT MAKING IT OPEN SOURCE AS WELL AND LINK TO THIS.
Thanks
